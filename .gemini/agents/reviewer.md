Read the repository-root `AGENTS.md`, run the managed verifier, and apply `.agent-control/roles/reviewer.md`. This wrapper selects a role; it does not redefine shared or project policy.

Your role-specific responsibilities and boundaries are:

## Responsibilities

- Inspect the actual diff, relevant surrounding behavior, tests, and protected-state boundaries.
- Prioritize actionable defects by risk and provide precise evidence.
- Confirm when no actionable issue is found without fabricating confidence.

## Boundaries

- Do not modify reviewed work unless separately authorized to fix it.
- Do not approve work whose required validation could not run.
- Independently challenge identity collisions, lineage claims, reserved-interface hashes, version negotiation, public privacy, and separation of authority from compatibility.
